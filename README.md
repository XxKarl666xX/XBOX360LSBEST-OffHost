*XBOX360LSBEST OffHost*<br/>
<sup>for XBOX 360 RGH/JTAG, only Black Ops 2</sub>
<br/>
<br/>

This is the source from the offhost that I work on.<br/>
The offhost is meant to look exactly like the offhost from XBOX360LSBEST.<br/>
The comments were meant only for me to get some stuff/not forget how certain stuff worked as the source is quite confusing at first.<br/>
The source I build it upon is "MyDarling V1"<br/>
Message features and a few others like cbuf stuff were ported from "Appendum"<br/>
All needed changes were made to the properties, it should compile out of the box without any problems.<br/>

I also made a little text guide on how to build your first ever .xex as something like that wasnt done properly before. The written guide is based off of this video which was made by "Silent Knight": <br/>

This video is the only video that shows how one would build a .xex, I dont get why people havent done more documentation about this topic. I couldnt find any other help online at all, even though others also have asked about this sort of stuff...<br/>
<br/>
*_"And why all of this?"_*<br/>
Maybe it helps the people who just started to create their own offhost for a xbox 360 cod and they want to get some refference and some sort of help yet havent found anything yet.<br/>
Its surprisingly hard to find help for this whole 'create your own offhost' stuff, which sucks. This console is so old, yet people never documented anything and arent helpfull at all after one asks questions. Just look around yourself and you see what I mean.<br/>
This offhost certainly wont be 'THE BEST SOLUTION FOR EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE WORLD!' but it might help to some small degree.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*To ADD/FIX:<br/>*
Some antiaim presets are wrong<br/>
healtbar on damage needs to be implemented<br/>
need to add fakelag<br/>
make the "visible" aimbottype work<br/>
need to implement offhost crash<br/>
make leave game/crash server bind to a button<br/>
